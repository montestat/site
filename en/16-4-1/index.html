            <p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>
<p>The Indicator measures the total value of inward and outward illicit financial flows (IFFs) in current United States dollars. IFFs are defined as &#x201C;financial flows that are illicit in origin, transfer or use, that reflect an exchange of value and that cross country borders&#x201D;.</p>
<p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>
<p>IFFs are defined as &#x201C;<strong>financial flows that are illicit in origin, transfer or use, that reflect an exchange of value and that cross country borders</strong>&#x201D;.</p>
<p>Thus, IFFs have the following features: </p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Illicit in origin, transfer or use</strong>. A flow of value is considered illicit if it is illicitly generated (e.g., originates from criminal activities or tax evasion), illicitly transferred (e.g., violating currency controls) or illicitly used (e.g., for financing terrorism). The flow can be licitly generated, transferred or used, but it must be illicit in at least one of these aspects. Some flows that are not illegal may fall within the definition of IFFs for statistical purposes, for example, cross-border aggressive tax avoidance which erodes the tax base of a country where that income was generated. </li>
  <li><strong>Exchange of value</strong>, rather than purely financial transfers. Exchange of value includes exchange of goods and services, and financial and non-financial assets. For instance, illicit cross-border bartering, meaning the illicit exchange of goods and services for other goods and services, is a common practice in illegal markets and it is considered as IFF.</li>
  <li>IFFs measure <strong>a flow of value over a given time</strong> - as opposed to a stock measure, which would be the accumulation of value. </li>
  <li><strong>Flows that cross a border</strong>.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2">[1]</a></sup></sup> This includes assets that cross borders and assets where the ownership changes from a resident of a country to a non-resident, even if the assets remain in the same jurisdiction. </li>
</ul>
<p>There are four main types of activities that can generate IFFs:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em><u>Illicit tax and commercial practices</u></em>: These include illicit practices by legal entities as well as arrangements and individuals with the objective of concealing revenues and reducing tax burden through evading controls and regulations. This category can be divided into two components: <ul>
      <li><strong>IFFs from illegal commercial activities and tax evasion</strong>. These include illegal practices such as tariff, duty and revenue offences, tax evasion, competition offences and market manipulation amongst others, as included in the International Classification of Crime for Statistical Purposes (ICCS)<sup><a href="#footnote-3" id="footnote-ref-3">[2]</a></sup>. Most of these activities are non-observed, hidden or part of the shadow, underground or informal economy that may generate IFFs. </li>
      <li><strong>IFFs from aggressive tax avoidance</strong>. Illicit flows can also be generated from legal economic activities through aggressive tax avoidance. This can take place through the manipulation of transfer pricing, strategic location of debt and intellectual property, tax treaty shopping and the use of hybrid instruments and entities. These flows need to be carefully considered, as they generally arise from legal business transactions and only the illicit part of the cross-border flows belongs within the scope of IFFs.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em><u>IFFs from illegal markets</u></em>: These include trade in illicit goods and services when the corresponding financial flows cross borders. The focus is on criminal activities where income is generated through exchange (trade) of illegal goods or services. Such processes often involve a degree of criminal organisation aimed at creating profit. They include any type of trafficking in goods, such as drugs and firearms, or services, such as smuggling of migrants. IFFs emerge from transnational trade in illicit goods and services, as well as from cross-border flows from managing the illicit income from such activities.</li>
  <li><em><u>IFFs from corruption</u></em>: The United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC) defines acts considered as corruption, and they are consistently defined in the ICCS, such as bribery, embezzlement, abuse of functions, trading in influence, illicit enrichment and other acts of corruption in the scope. When these acts &#x2013; directly or indirectly - generate cross-border flows, they generate IFFs. </li>
  <li><em><u>Exploitation-type activities, and financing of crime and terrorism:</u></em> Exploitation-type activities are non-productive activities that entail a forced, involuntary and illicit transfer of economic resources between two actors. Terrorism financing and financing of crime are illicit, voluntary transfers of funds between two actors. Examples of exploitation-type activities are sexual exploitation, theft, extortion, illicit enrichment, and kidnapping. When the related financial flows cross country borders, they constitute IFFs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other relevant concepts include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em><u>Inward IFFs</u></em>: IFFs entering a country.</li>
  <li><em><u>Outward IFFs</u></em>: IFFs leaving a country.</li>
  <li><em><u>Illicit income generation</u></em>: This refers to the set of transactions that either directly generate illicit income for an actor during a productive or non-productive illicit activity, or that are performed in the context of the production of illicit goods and services. A transaction constitutes an IFF when it crosses country borders.</li>
  <li><em><u>Illicit income management</u></em>: These transactions use illicit income to invest in (legal or illegal) financial and non-financial assets or to consume (legal or illegal) goods and services. A transaction constitutes an IFFs when it crosses country borders.</li>
  <li><em><u>Illegal markets</u></em> comprise all transactions related to the production and the trade with a certain illicit good or service. Regardless of the illicit nature, these market activities are considered as being economically productive, because value added is generated at each transaction. The value added describes the net increase in value (price times quantity) of the product at each transaction.</li>
</ul>

            <p>Data providers are natural (individuals) or legal persons (businesses or institutions) who report their data for different purposes. Thus, relevant data are held by national statistical offices, central banks, tax authorities, customs, financial intelligence centres, criminal justice institutions, including courts, police, military, etc. They collect primary data from individuals, businesses, institutions and other statistical units either for statistical purposes or for their administrative work. Focal points at the national level are responsible for compiling the indicator and submitting it in collaboration with the national statistical office. </p>

        <td>
          
            <p>The statistical definition of IFFs provides a comprehensive definition of the phenomenon to be measured. It does not focus on a specific measurement approach, like trade asymmetry, only but will rely on a combination of methods to estimate different types of IFFs. </p>
<p>The disaggregated and bottom-up measurement approach is in line with existing frameworks such as the System of National Accounts and the Balance of Payments and it follows international efforts to measure non-observed or illegal economic activities. </p>
<p>SDG Indicator 16.4.1 calls for the measurement of the &#x201C;total value&#x201D; of inward and outward IFFs. While this is useful as an indication of the overall size of the problem and for measuring progress, a more granular measurement of IFFs helps to identify the main sources and channels of IFFs and can guide interventions targeting IFFs. </p>
<p>Countries are affected by different types of IFFs and it is suggested that main types of IFFs are defined at country level. This limits the possibility of measuring all types of IFFs in a comprehensive manner and comparability may be affected by different coverage from one country to another. However, the goal is to capture the most significant flows at country level and a gradual process of improving the exhaustiveness of the Indicator is expected, following the model of measuring illegal economic activities and the non-observed economy in the balance of payments and national accounts.</p>
<p>There is a risk of double-counting when adding together explicit estimates of activities generating IFFs. Estimates for IFFs should not be simply added together, because they may already include parts of others (e.g., drug trafficking and bribery) and there may be double-counting. During the expert consultations, double counting was discussed and will be addressed in guidelines issued to member states.</p>

            <p><strong>Data availability:</strong></p>
<p>Data collection has not yet started. It is expected that the number of countries for which this indicator is available will gradually start increasing over time. According to inventories, over 60 per cent of countries globally already collect some data that can be used in the estimation of IFFs. However, notably efforts are planned to support countries in building their capacity to measure Indicator 16.4.1. Currently, pioneering countries are pilot testing the indicator compilation. Estimates will also be prepared in countries participating in UNCTAD and UNODC capacity building projects, carried out currently jointly with ESCAP and ECA.</p>
<p><strong>Time series:</strong></p>
<p>Availability of time series would be useful for the analysis of development over time. Feasibility of constructing historical time series data will be reviewed.</p>
<p><strong>Disaggregation:</strong></p>
<p>Similar to Eurostat&#x2019;s recommendations on measuring illegal economic activities, a disaggregated measurement approach is proposed. As a minimum, disaggregation of the index by relevant types of IFFs, should be published separately for the main elements, depending on data availability: </p>
<p>&#x2022; IFFs from illicit tax and commercial practices, </p>
<p>&#x2022; IFFs from illegal markets, </p>
<p>&#x2022; IFFs from corruption, and</p>
<p>&#x2022; IFFs from exploitation-type and financing of crime and terrorism.</p>
<p>In addition, member states may decide to disaggregate the IFF indicator, where relevant, by:</p>
<p>&#x2022; payment method (cash / trade flows / crypto currencies)</p>
<p>&#x2022; resulting assets (offshore wealth / real estate etc.)</p>
<p>&#x2022; actors (characters of individuals / types of businesses etc.)</p>
<p>&#x2022; industries, commodities or service categories.</p>
